# Fraud-Adjusted-Customer-Lifetime-Value-CLV-Analytics


🚀 Project Overview

In fintech and digital banking, traditional Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) models are misleading because they ignore fraud losses, customer churn after fraud, and operational costs.
This project builds a Fraud-Adjusted CLV Analytics system that helps leadership answer:

Are we growing profitably, or are fraud and risk eroding customer value?

The solution combines SQL-ready business logic, advanced Power BI DAX, and executive-grade dashboards to deliver actionable fraud, risk, and customer profitability insights.


🧠 Business Problem

Financial institutions face three critical challenges:

Revenue growth hides fraud impact
High transaction volume may look healthy while fraud silently destroys value.

Fraud controls can cause customer churn
Over-blocking and false positives lead to customer loss, especially in high-value segments.

One-size-fits-all fraud rules fail
Risk tolerance varies by channel, income band, and customer risk profile.
